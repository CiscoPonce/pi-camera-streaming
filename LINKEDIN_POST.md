**Excited to share my latest project: Raspberry Pi 5 Camera Streaming Solution! üçìüìπ**

Just finished developing a professional, low-latency camera streaming system that demonstrates my passion for embedded systems and real-time technologies.

**What I've built:**
‚úÖ **Sub-500ms latency** WebRTC streaming with HTTP-FLV fallback
‚úÖ **Docker containerisation** for scalable deployment
‚úÖ **Performance profiles** (day/night/low-latency modes)
‚úÖ **One-command setup** with comprehensive documentation
‚úÖ **Professional web interface** with real-time controls
‚úÖ **Production-ready** with systemd integration and auto-recovery

**Technical highlights:**
‚Ä¢ Raspberry Pi 5 + Camera Module 3 optimisation
‚Ä¢ SRS streaming server with WebRTC support
‚Ä¢ Nginx with security headers and performance tuning
‚Ä¢ Hardware-accelerated H.264 encoding
‚Ä¢ Multi-protocol streaming (WebRTC, RTMP, HTTP-FLV)
‚Ä¢ Automated deployment and monitoring

This project showcases my skills in:
üîß Embedded systems development
üåê Real-time video streaming protocols
üê≥ Containerisation and DevOps
‚ö° Performance optimisation
üìö Professional technical documentation
üéØ Portfolio-quality project management

Perfect for IoT applications, security monitoring, and live streaming scenarios. The entire system is production-ready with automated deployment scripts and comprehensive API documentation.

**Repository:** https://github.com/CiscoPonce/pi-camera-streaming

As a recent graduate, I'm passionate about creating practical solutions that bridge hardware and software. This project represents months of learning, testing, and optimising to achieve professional-grade results.

Would love to connect with fellow developers interested in embedded systems, streaming technologies, or IoT solutions!

## üéØ **Post Strategy:**

### **Key Messages:**
1. **Recent Graduate**: Emphasise your fresh perspective and enthusiasm
2. **Technical Skills**: Showcase specific technologies and achievements
3. **Professional Quality**: Highlight production-ready features
4. **Portfolio Ready**: Emphasise clean, professional repository
5. **Community Engagement**: Invite connections and discussions

### **UK English Features Used:**
- "containerisation" (not "containerization")
- "optimisation" (not "optimization")
- "realise" concepts (not "realize")
- British spelling throughout

### **Hashtag Strategy:**
- **Primary**: #RaspberryPi #WebRTC #Docker #IoT
- **Secondary**: #EmbeddedSystems #VideoStreaming #TechGraduate
- **Community**: #OpenSource #SoftwareDevelopment #Portfolio

### **Engagement Tips:**
