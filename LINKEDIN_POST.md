**Excited to share my latest project: Raspberry Pi 5 Camera Streaming Solution! 🍓📹**

Just finished developing a professional, low-latency camera streaming system that demonstrates my passion for embedded systems and real-time technologies.

**What I've built:**
✅ **Sub-500ms latency** WebRTC streaming with HTTP-FLV fallback
✅ **Docker containerisation** for scalable deployment
✅ **Performance profiles** (day/night/low-latency modes)
✅ **Automated setup** with comprehensive documentation
✅ **Professional web interface** with real-time monitoring

**Technical highlights:**
• Raspberry Pi 5 + Camera Module 3 optimisation
• SRS streaming server with WebRTC support
• Nginx with security headers and performance tuning
• Hardware-accelerated video encoding
• System monitoring and health checks

This project showcases my skills in:
🔧 Embedded systems development
🌐 Real-time video streaming protocols
🐳 Containerisation and DevOps
⚡ Performance optimisation
📚 Technical documentation

Perfect for IoT applications, security monitoring, and live streaming scenarios. The entire system is production-ready with automated deployment scripts and comprehensive troubleshooting guides.

As a recent graduate, I'm passionate about creating practical solutions that bridge hardware and software. This project represents months of learning, testing, and optimising to achieve professional-grade results.

Would love to connect with fellow developers interested in embedded systems, streaming technologies, or IoT solutions!
